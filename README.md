Fork by FRC West - we are maintaining the project for 2015, hopefully to help local teams have a common base.

# atalibj #

ATALibJ (or atalibj) is a library based on [WPILibJ](http://firstforge.wpi.edu/sf/projects/wpilib) for developing robots for the [FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)](http://www.usfirst.org/). It's two main areas of focus are simplicity and predictability which, together, will help FRC programmers write better code faster by improving ease-of-use.

## Purpose ##

atalibj is ultimately seeking to be a complete replacement for WPILibJ with more uniformity and predictability from the API side. We're looking to provide users with the ability to easily make minor changes between different input and output devices as well as to increase productivity in writing code. Through uniformity, we hope to ensure that the user can spend more time writing code and less time questioning which method to call.

## Contributing ##

Before contributing to atalibj, please make sure that you've read the purpose carefully and understand the purpose of the project! With that in mind, all you need to do is fork the library and commit away. Once you've finished making your changes, go ahead and send us a pull request. 

Contributing to this fork is essentially the de-facto 'official' version, but not formally so.

## Project Goals ##

* Provide features that make it more useful than wpilibj
* Enhance the programmer's experience to make good code fast, efficiently and without a large learning curve
* Provide a stable, secure and safe base to base other programs on
* Perform well enough for any project
* Be high enough caliber of an API that it is useful for every FRC team
