/**
 * A module is the standard for everything that performs some kind of function
 * on the robot. There are three general types of modules:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Actuators and Sensors - the base parts of a robot
 * <li> Virtual control - virtual processes that actuate the first group (ex.
 * PID, bang-bang, TBH)
 * <li> {@link Subsystem Subsystems} - groups of modules that perform more
 * useful functions than the actuators and sensors
 * </ul>
 *
 * This interface creates some basic standards that are upheld across the entire
 * library. It lets classes do whatever they need to, while upholding a general
 * contract of how to behave. Specifically, it allows modules to be enabled and
 * disabled at will. When the user needs the functionality of a module, they can
 * enable it. When they do not need its function, they can disable it.
 *
 * The general contract for all modules is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Modules contain methods specific to their purpose, but do not expose
 * their composed instances for security reasons
 * <li> Modules are "ready" to work when {@link #init()} has been called, and
 * its functions will work after {@link #enable()} is called.
 * <li> "Settings" of a module, AKA its internal state, are changeable even when
 * disabled.
 * <li> Between calling {@link #enable()} and
 * {@link #disable()}, {@link #isEnabled()} will return true. Only
 * {@code enable()} and {@code disable()} can effect the output of
 * {@code isEnabled()}.
 * <li> If a function is called while the module is disabled, the function
 * should throw a {@link IllegalStateException}.
 * <li> Calling any of the methods more than once in a row will not behave
 * differently because of it.
 * <li> The state of {@link #isEnabled()} should be thread-safe and <i>only</i>
 * return {@code true} when it is completely enabled.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> {@link Module.StartardModule} is a useful default implementation of
 * {@code Module} that fulfills most of the {@code Module} contract.
