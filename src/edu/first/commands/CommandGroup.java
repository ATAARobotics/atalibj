 * Is only designed to be subclasses, and should not be instantiated as itself

 *
 * <p> Sequential commands are run after the command before it, and are done
 * before the next command.
 *
 * <p> Concurrent commands are run at the same time as all concurrent commands
 * around it.
 *
 * <p> To add sequential command, use
 * {@link CommandGroup#addSequential(edu.ATA.command.Command)}, and to add
 * concurrent commands, use
 * {@link CommandGroup#addConcurrent(edu.ATA.command.Command)}.
