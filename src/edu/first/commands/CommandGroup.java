/**
 * Command that encompasses multiple commands strung together. Runs commands
 * sequentially or concurrently in groups, in the order of how they are added.
 * Is only designed to be subclassed, and should not be instantiated as itself
 * (thus the only constructor being protected).
 *
 * <p>
 * Sequential commands are run after the command before it, and are done before
 * the next command.
 *
 * <p>
 * Concurrent commands are run at the same time as all concurrent commands
 * around it. A sequential command between concurrent commands will prevent
 * those concurrent commands from being run together.
 *
 * <p>
 * To add sequential command, use
 * {@link #appendSequential(edu.ATA.command.Command)}, and to add concurrent
 * commands, use {@link #appendConcurrent(edu.ATA.command.Command)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Command Groups look like this:
 * <pre>
 * public final class ExampleCommand extends CommandGroup {
 *     public ExampleCommand() {
 *         appendSequential(new F());
 *         appendSequential(new F1());
 *         appendConcurrent(new F2());
 *         appendConcurrent(new F3());
 *         appendConcurrent(new F4());
 *         appendSequential(new F5());
 *         appendConcurrent(new F6());
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this example, this execution will go as follows:
 * <pre>
 * F
 * F1
 * F2 + F3 + F4
 * F5
 * F6
 * </pre>
