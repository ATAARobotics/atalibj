<p>ATALibJ (or atalibj) is a library based on <a href="http://firstforge.wpi.edu/sf/projects/wpilib">WPILibJ</a> for developing robots for the <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)</a>. It's two main areas of focus are simplicity and predictability which, together, will help FRC programmers write better code faster by improving ease-of-use.</p>

<h2>
<a name="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h2>

<p>atalibj is ultimately seeking to be a complete replacement for WPILibJ with more uniformity and predictability from the API side. We're looking to provide users with the ability to easily make minor changes between different input and output devices as well as to increase productivity in writing code. Through uniformity, we hope to ensure that the user can spend more time writing code and less time questioning which method to call. We would also like to help make development easier and as such intend on including an improved version of <a href="https://github.com/Team4334/gordian">gordian</a>.</p>

Please note that the final decision on pull requests will ultimately be made by <a href="https://github.com/joelg236">Joel Gallant</a> and that his decision is law.</p>

<h2>
<a name="project-goals" class="anchor" href="#project-goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Provide features that make it more useful than wpilibj</li>
<li>Enhance the programmer's experience to make good code fast, efficiently and without a large learning curve</li>
<li>Provide a stable, secure and safe base to base other programs on</li>
<li>Perform well enough for any project</li>
<li>Be high enough caliber of an API that it is useful for every FRC team</li>
<li>Ultimately, to replace wpilibj as the library most used by Java FRC programs</li>
